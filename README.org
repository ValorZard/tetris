They have great tutorials.

-------------
Crud, so I didnt see the part about it being a noncommercial license. Ah well.

TODO:
- Add SRS rotation system (or some other rotation system, idk)
- Add 7 bag randomization
- Add scalibility, so that the board can rotate, shrink and grow, and you should still be able to play tetris regardless
    - this will probably be done by removing references to Unity's own transform system, and make it so that everything takes place within the grid.
- Also add a grace period at the top with a few invisible lines, so that theres more of a chance to survive if an piece spawns on top of a giant stack
